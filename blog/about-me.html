    <p>Kia ora koutou,

      Ko Kaukau tōku maunga, nō te Whanganui-a-Tara ahau, ko Lauren tōku ingoa. My name is Lauren (she/her) and I’m currently living in Wellington. I’ve been thinking about connection, and how genuine human connection is one of my core values. I’m sure many of you have heard this one, but my favourite Whakataukī is ‘He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tāngata, he tāngata, he tāngata!’, ‘What is the most important thing in the world? The people, the people, the people’. I recently finished my Bachelors in classical performance, where I connected to people through music. Now I’m taking a different approach and hoping to connect through tech! I’ve done a little bit of code before, so I’m very excited to strengthen those skills at dev academy, and hopefully break into the tech industry. I’m especially excited to meet lots of new people here! 
      </p>
    <p>Outside of Dev Academy I enjoy making music, going on walks, and playing any indie games my laptop can handle (Hollow Knight and Stardew Valley are my favourites!)
