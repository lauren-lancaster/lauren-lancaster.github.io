          <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
              <ol>
                <li class="listText">What is EQ?</li>
                <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, reflect, and manage your own emotions to improve your own mental state, as well as your environment and your relationship with others. This can include effective conflict resolution, effective communication and mindfulness.
                </p>
                <p>A person with emotional intelligence will have the ability to understand and manage their emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Broken down, it can be defined by self-awareness, self-management, motivation, social awareness and relationship management. Emotional intelligence is key to a happy, successful life.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Self Awareness:</li>
                  <p>Understanding your emotions, strengths and weaknesses so you can bring out the best in yourself. Not letting your emotions rule you. Bye to take Mann honest and critical look at themselves.
                  </p>
                  <li>Self Management:</li>
                  <p>Turn reactions into responses. Doesn’t make impulsive decisions.</p>
                  <li>Motivated:</li>                    
                  <p>Comfortable with long term gratification and motivated to work for it.</p>
                  <li>Social Awareness:</li>
                  <p>Reading the room and practicing empathy. Being able to recognise the wants, needs and perspective of the people around them.</p>
                  <li>Relationship Management:</li>
                  <p>Being able to have difficult conversations with others for conflict resolution, as well as mentoring, coaching and influencing others. Also an effective communicator.</p>
                </ul>
                <li class="listText">How is EQ different from IQ?</li>
                <p>To put it bluntly, EQ is emotional awareness and control, and IQ is mental ability. IQ refers to intellectual ability, and is defined by a person’s ability to understand complex ideas, problem solve, and strategise. IQ may make someone qualified for the technical aspects of a job, but doesn’t factor into a person’s ability to work with others. It also doesn’t have much to contribute to the mental state of an individual.</p>
                <p>Many researchers suggest that high EQ is a better indicator of success than IQ. This isn’t just in the workplace, but also in a person’s personal life as well. People with high EQ make better leaders and team players, and they’re also driven when working by themselves.</p>
                <li class="listText">Why is EQ important?</li>                  
                <p>EQ plays a large role in how we manage in all aspects of life. Having a higher EQ will mean performing better in the workplace, as well as being favoured for jobs and promotions. Motivation will be higher and decision making will be less impulsive. Relationships with others will be more successful both inside and outside of the workplace. In general, a person wit higher EQ will be more sure of themselves, and more reliable in a crisis, as they will ‘respond’ to the situation and their emotions rather than ‘react’.</p>
