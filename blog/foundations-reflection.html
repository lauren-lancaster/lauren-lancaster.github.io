                  <p>
                    I work best when I have set habits and a routine. Eg. Practising mindfulness then journalling for five minutes every day before I start my work. On my lunch break stepping away from the screen to take a walk or cook a good meal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have a tendency to avoid tasks that I think will be boring or difficult, and I do this by working on other tasks. Currently I’m a person who requires instant gratification, but I’m working on this so I can singularly focus on the task that needs to be done at the time, regardless of my feelings on it. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have a tendency to get sucked into problems and will waste time getting frustrated with them rather than taking a break or asking for help
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</li>
                  <p> 
                    Our values and empathy shape the way we work with others, both colleagues and clients. Our values can also influence our projects, from the language we use, to accessibility features we might include.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Self awareness of our strengths and limitations is how we hold ourselves accountable and push our abilities. Being aware of our own habits and emotions can be a great strength when learning. For example, if you are able to recognise when you’re negatively self talking, being able to address that and reframe your mindset rather than indulge in it will help encourage the brain to learn and overcome.

                  <li class="listText">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>    
                  <p> 
                    I was surprised by how much more I have to learn about myself. As part of core I did a lot of self reflection, and realised a lot about how I approach problems and what I unconsciously do to make things more difficult for myself, like procrastination or negative self talk.
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
                  <p>
                    Following through on all the goals I set for myself. Creating habits takes a long time, so I often struggled to meet goals like meditating every day, taking walks on my breaks, or asking for help after I’d been stuck on a problem for fifteen minutes. It’s something I’ve been pushing myself to get better at during foundations, though some weeks are better than others.
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</li>
                  <p>
                    Because in the tech industry they are currently looking for people with outstanding human skills who can add to the culture of a company, communicate effectively, and work with others. Just knowing how to code won’t give you an edge when looking for career growth. The most successful leaders are the ones with high emotional intelligence.
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</li>
                  <p>
                    It doesn’t feel like a waste of time. Part of the reason why I came to Dev Academy is because of how it teaches soft skills. If the course focused primarily on code, no matter how hard I worked during bootcamp, I wouldn’t have an edge on someone with a 3-4 year degree. Plus, these days when job seeking, having the skills for job isn’t enough. You need to be able to bring people skills to the table as well.
