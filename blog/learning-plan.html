            <li class="listText">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
            <p>My career pathway goal is to land a job in the tech industry. Ideally this would be as a full stack web developer, but if the opportunity ever arose I would love to get into game development as well. My ideal job would be one where I could work in a team and continue to learn. It would be amazing if I could incorporate my musical skills in some way as well.</p>
            <li class="listText">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>
            <p>In sprint 2 I said that my strength was that I was a good solver. I believe this still rings true, especially after all learning all the new problem solving techniques in sprint 4. In particular, I’ve found pseudocode and journalling to be effective tools for me and typically they’re what I first turn to when starting a project or stuck on a problem. I know myself well enough to know when I’ve reached a block because of lack of knowledge, or because my mind has hit a wall. When I need to I use google or ask questions in the Discord, but when I’m up against that wall I step away from the computer to fold a paper crane, get some water and tea, and if I’m really stuck do a little journalling or rubber ducking.</p>
            <p>I initially said that a limitation of mine was time keeping. I’ve come to take a more holistic view of this limitation and come to realise its a symptom of a larger drawback, and that’s my ability to follow through on the goals that I’ve set for myself. As we know, habits and routines take a long time to build, and starting this course I set myself a large but necessary number of new habits I wanted to have. These were things like regular sleeping hours, healthy eating patterns, frequent exercise, practicing mindfulness every day, working eight hours every day, facing tasks head on, and asking for help fifteen minutes after getting stuck. A lot of these habits contribute to my ability to effectively time keeping, so when some of them would inevitably slip, my time keeping would get worse. During bootcamp I think this is going to initially hinder me, but if I can keep working on meeting these goals and eventually get all of them consistent, that’s going to make a huge difference to how well I work and learn during and after bootcamp.</p>
            <li class="listText">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li>
            <p>Definitely staying focused for nine weeks. I’ve never done anything as intensive as bootcamp before, so I’m a bit nervous about how well I’ll fare doing intensive study for nine weeks. I know that when I get overwhelmed my self care tends to slip, which can make my motivation and energy take a dramatic plunge. Therefore I don’t want to just stay focused on learning for nine weeks, but on my own self care too.</p>
            <li class="listText">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
            <p>I would really like to develop my skills on dealing with conflict and having courageous conversations. Conflict is typically something I try to avoid, and in the situations where I have to have courageous conversations, I don’t really know how to go about them. Ideally I would like to feel less anxious about conflict when it arises because I’ll have developed a toolbox for dealing with it and improving the situation for everyone involved.</p>
            <li class="listText">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
            <p>For me, support would look like regular check-ins, on both the technical and non-technical side of things. Receiving solid advice and guidance when problem arrives would be super helpful. So far, the foundations team have been very kind and supportive, so I would love to see this welcoming learning environment continue to be fostered.</p>
            <li class="listText">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li>
            <p>Since bootcamp is so short I want to make sure I’m making the most of every day at bootcamp. I’m committing to getting at least eight hours of sleep every night, eating three meals a day and exercising whenever I can so that I can bring my a-game to bootcamp every day. If I find myself struggling, either emotionally or with the course content, I’ll be sure to see a facilitator as soon as possible to discuss solutions before the problem spirals out of control.</p>

              <ol>
                  <li class="listText">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
                  <p>My goal is to become proficient enough in code to secure a job in the tech industry, and to build my core skills enough to be an effective member of a team. My career pathway goal is to secure a job in the tech industry, ideally working in web development. Front or back end or a combo of both is fine.

                  <li class="listText">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
                  </li>
                  <p>I’m a good problem solver. I’m easily able to break problems down into small chunks that I can manage, and I also know how to go looking for solutions, whether from online research or learning from my peers. A limitation of mine is that I’m not good at time keeping. I often set time goals for myself to try improve this, however I’ll find myself switching between tasks or getting hung up over one specific task for too long. Sometimes this will lead to me forgoing breaks, when a break is actually all I need to be able to solve a problem.
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
                  <p>I would like to improve my communication skills. I often struggle to convey my ideas effectively and concisely, and sometimes this can make me nervous when talking to others, which exacerbates the problem. I would also like improve my ability to follow through on goals, especially time-timekeeping goals.</p>
                  <li class="listText">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</li>
                  <p>Keeping consistent with my goal setting and achieving will be essential. Currently, I set myself goals every morning, which often include time-keeping goals. If I continue to goal set, and work hard to make a habit out of time-boxing, I think that will keep up my productivity throughout the course. For my own safety, I need to make sure I’m taking regular breaks as well, and during these breaks I should make sure to eat, go outside, and exercise if I can. To work safely with other learners,  Facilitators, and industry/community representatives, learning good communication skill will be essential. Asking for help when I need it so I don’t waste time on a solvable problem is my top priority, and something I’ve already started working on. I will also ensure that I’m always professional when communicating with others as well. This includes being respectful and polite, actively listening, and coming prepared to meetings. When things start to build up and get to me I’ll be especially sure to ask for help when I need it, and communicate with Facilitators when I feel I’m falling behind or may need an extension. I have a bad habit 	of neglecting self-care when I get overwhelmed, so making a conscious effort to eat healthy, drink water, and get enough sleep during these times is also a goal of mine. 
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
                  <p>After being stuck on a problem for 15 minutes, I’ll take the problem to my home group to ask for advice. If I’m unable to fix my problem there, I’ll take it to the appropriate discord channel and seek help there.</p>
                  <li class="listText">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
                  <p>I expect the facilitation team to be available during normal working hours to answer questions and assist with troubleshooting. I also expect them to be friendly and encouraging when answering questions in order to maintain a comfortable and safe environment where everyone feels okay asking for help, even if the questions seem silly.</p>
                  <li class="listText">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</li>
                  <p>I’ve kept all my daytimes free for dev academy, with the exception of May 18th, which is my uni graduation day. I’ll have to take the full day off for this, so I’m expecting to work through the surrounding weekends and maybe pull a few longer days that week as well to keep up with the course work. I also have a zoom call scheduled for April 14th, and I have to participate in the Anzac services on the 25th, but both of these only take place during the morning and I expect to be able to make up the lost time on the same day, or during the weekend if I have to. Otherwise my only other commitments are during evenings and weekends, and those will be dropping off when bootcamp begins, with the exception of my rehearsals with the Airforce band on Monday nights. I’m currently keeping up a 9-5 schedule during the week, so my evening commitments haven’t interfered with my learning, and I don’t intend to let them.</p>
