                  <li class="listText">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
                  <p>My goal is to become proficient enough in code to secure a job in the tech industry, and to build my core skills enough to be an effective member of a team. My career pathway goal is to secure a job in the tech industry, ideally working in web development. Front or back end or a combo of both is fine.

                  <li class="listText">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
                  </li>
                  <p>I’m a good problem solver. I’m easily able to break problems down into small chunks that I can manage, and I also know how to go looking for solutions, whether from online research or learning from my peers. A limitation of mine is that I’m not good at time keeping. I often set time goals for myself to try improve this, however I’ll find myself switching between tasks or getting hung up over one specific task for too long. Sometimes this will lead to me forgoing breaks, when a break is actually all I need to be able to solve a problem.
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
                  <p>I would like to improve my communication skills. I often struggle to convey my ideas effectively and concisely, and sometimes this can make me nervous when talking to others, which exacerbates the problem. I would also like improve my ability to follow through on goals, especially time-timekeeping goals.</p>
                  <li class="listText">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</li>
                  <p>Keeping consistent with my goal setting and achieving will be essential. Currently, I set myself goals every morning, which often include time-keeping goals. If I continue to goal set, and work hard to make a habit out of time-boxing, I think that will keep up my productivity throughout the course. For my own safety, I need to make sure I’m taking regular breaks as well, and during these breaks I should make sure to eat, go outside, and exercise if I can. To work safely with other learners,  Facilitators, and industry/community representatives, learning good communication skill will be essential. Asking for help when I need it so I don’t waste time on a solvable problem is my top priority, and something I’ve already started working on. I will also ensure that I’m always professional when communicating with others as well. This includes being respectful and polite, actively listening, and coming prepared to meetings. When things start to build up and get to me I’ll be especially sure to ask for help when I need it, and communicate with Facilitators when I feel I’m falling behind or may need an extension. I have a bad habit 	of neglecting self-care when I get overwhelmed, so making a conscious effort to eat healthy, drink water, and get enough sleep during these times is also a goal of mine. 
                  </p>
                  <li class="listText">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
                  <p>After being stuck on a problem for 15 minutes, I’ll take the problem to my home group to ask for advice. If I’m unable to fix my problem there, I’ll take it to the appropriate discord channel and seek help there.</p>
                  <li class="listText">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
                  <p>I expect the facilitation team to be available during normal working hours to answer questions and assist with troubleshooting. I also expect them to be friendly and encouraging when answering questions in order to maintain a comfortable and safe environment where everyone feels okay asking for help, even if the questions seem silly.</p>
                  <li class="listText">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</li>
                  <p>I’ve kept all my daytimes free for dev academy, with the exception of May 18th, which is my uni graduation day. I’ll have to take the full day off for this, so I’m expecting to work through the surrounding weekends and maybe pull a few longer days that week as well to keep up with the course work. I also have a zoom call scheduled for April 14th, and I have to participate in the Anzac services on the 25th, but both of these only take place during the morning and I expect to be able to make up the lost time on the same day, or during the weekend if I have to. Otherwise my only other commitments are during evenings and weekends, and those will be dropping off when bootcamp begins, with the exception of my rehearsals with the Airforce band on Monday nights. I’m currently keeping up a 9-5 schedule during the week, so my evening commitments haven’t interfered with my learning, and I don’t intend to let them.</p>
