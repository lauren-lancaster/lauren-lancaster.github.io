            <li class="listText">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</li>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is how the intact brain can learn, and the damaged brain can relearn. Its benefits are widespread and varied, from rehabilitation of the damaged brain, to learning a musical instrument. It is the basis for building habits and learning skills. This is done through repeated and consistent ‘deep practice’. By repeatedly firing up a connection between neurons, myelin (an insulating layer that forms around the nerves) is strengthened and thickened around the pathways, making the connection between neurons faster and stronger. This is how ingrained habits are formed and skills learned.</p>
            <li class="listText">How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</li>
            <p>In the context of dev academy, I can use neuroplasticity for my learning. With coding in particular, I want to strengthen my pathways for learning how to code, rather than memorising the solutions for specific problems. Practicing problem solving with coding every day will help me develop skills that I can use throughout my learning journey. Using mindfulness will also be helpful, particularly with being able to visualise the skills I am learning and reflect on them. Mental practice is essential in learning new skills, and studies have shown that effective mental practice stimulates the same neurons as physical practice does. Taking time to step back from my screen and reflect on what I have learned will help me to retain more knowledge.  </p>
            <li class="listText">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</li>
            <p>In the book The Talent Code, Daniel Coyle discusses a concept he calls ‘deep practice’ as a way of increasing neuroplasticity. To deep practice, you must struggle in targeted ways, and operate at the edge of your ability, or as Dev Academy calls it, the ‘learning zone’. This is the zone where mistakes are made, however by actively learning by puzzling through those mistakes and correcting them, you learn much faster than passively receiving information and solutions. The key to deep practice is to choose a goal just beyond the edge of your current capabilities then strive to meet it.</p>
            <p>Repetition is another way to increase neuroplasticity. Repeating a targeted area of learning will help to build and reinforce the pathways between neurons. However its important to note that the repetition shouldn’t be mindless. Active repetition where you focus every time on what could be better, then seek to implement a solution on the next iteration, is far more effective. Repetition doesn’t have to always be physical, but could be done through mental practice/visualisation as well.</p>
            <p>Simply knowing about the principles of neuroplasticity can be enough to make your mind more malleable as well. The knowledge that intelligence is grown, not fixed, can be inspiring and empowering. Often it can help to flip the switch between ‘passive’ and ‘active’ learning.</p>

          <h2 class="contentHeader">Growth Mindset</h3>
           <ol>
             <li class="listText">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</li>
              <p>Growth mindset is the theory that the intelligence and ability are not fixed or predetermined. Through making mistakes and struggling, learning can increase the most. However the key to benefiting from this growth is believing that you can (AKA - maintaining a growth mindset). A growth mindset is relevant to everyone. Part of the human condition is to spend your life learning and growing. As soon as you think you’ve hit your limit, you’ll lose that mindset, tricking yourself into becoming static in your abilities.</p>
            <li class="listText">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
            <p>I have been familiar with this concept for some time. I extensively studied the growth mindset while completing my music degree and applied it to my daily practice. What surprised me was that even though I had built this habit into my musical study, I’ve been failing to apply it to my learning journey at Dev Academy. Upon reflection, I’ve noticed that I’ve tended to stay more in my comfort zone than my learning zone, when to be making the most of the course I should be striving to sit on the very edge of my learning zone. So far I’ve had a tendency to back off from challenges I struggle with.</p>
          <li class="listText">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
            <p>The first place to start is with self-talk. Changing the messages I give myself to reflect a growth-mindset rather than a fixed one is essential. It’s also important to challenge myself, ask questions and stay curious. Persisting through challenges and pushing outside of my comfort zone will only benefit me.</p>

          <li class="listText">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</li>
            <p>One of my learning limitations identified in my learning plan was time management. I think the reason I struggle with time management is that when a task feels to hard or overwhelming, I’ll instinctively try to find an easier task rather than focus on the one at hand. To stay on track I should practice using a growth mindset, remembering that mistakes and failures are positive outcomes and that the best way for me to learn is to stay on track and focus on the task at hand. If I’m really stuck, other things I can try instead of avoiding my problems is taking a short break away from my screen, or asking for help.</p>
            <p>I also wanted to improve my goal setting and keeping, however after this research I want to change that to be <em>reframing </em>my goal setting and keeping. Right now my goal keeping focuses on the time boxes and on how much learning I can achieve in a day. I think I want to switch my goals from focusing on how much I can learn in aa time frame to <em>what </em>I can learn.</p>
