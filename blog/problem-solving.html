          <li class="listText">Were blocked on a simple problem</li>
          <p>My biggest block came during the Builtin Methods capitalisation challenge. I did my pseudocode and worked out the problem and wrote up a few lines that were very almost right. However when I tried to test it my return came back with a distressing lack of capital letters. I spent a long time trying different things with my code, playing around with bracket placement, and googling the methods I was using over and over again to see if I’d missed a bit of syntax. I was starting to feel incredibly frustrated, so I decided to send a quick SOS to the discord and start my lunch break early. This worked a charm, as it turned out I’d forgotten to assign my new map array to a variable. From this I learned that the things I map need to be assigned to variables. I also learned that asking for help can help me learn quicker and more effectively than trying to force my way through a problem I don’t fully understand with trial and error.</p>
          <li class="listText">Elegantly solved a problem</li>
          <p>I got stuck on the finding Scooby challenge for quite some time. Looking at the index for testing the challenge confused me a little and I was uncertain on how to go about solving the problem. Again, I wrote up some code that was very almost right, but failed to return the Scooby object when I ran it. I tried a few different methods, which, even after my discovery that I’d been searching for ‘Shaggy’ instead of ‘Scooby’ the whole time, failed to work. I decided to take a fifteen minute break to clear my head a little. When I came back I checked through the test index again and wrote down everything I needed to check for and what variables I needed to use in my pseudocode. I tried again, and solved the problem on my second try (I had been using the wrong key name in my find() method). It took me less than five minutes. I was feeling pretty frustrated and confused before I took me break, but after I’d stepped away from the screen for a bit I was remarkably clear headed and felt pretty good about solving the problem so quickly. I learned that taking a quick break helps me work faster if I feel I’m coming up against blocks.</p>

              <td class="tableContents">Pretty confident, I’ve been using this one a lot and its been really effective for me. Before learning about it I solved a lot of problems through journalling, so this is kind of like journalling in my code.</td>

            <tr>
              <td class="tableContents">Trying Something</td>
              <td class="tableContents">I also do this one a lot, to varying degrees of success. I’m pretty confident with my ability to try stuff, though not so confident with my ability to try stuff successfully. What I’ve found most helpful with this one is trying stuff that will give me different error messages.</td>

              <td class="tableContents">Rubber Ducky</td>
              <td class="tableContents">I don’t have a duck (though there’s a family that live outside my house, maybe I should talk to them). I tend to talk to myself pretty constantly when I’m working, so this is just something I do as I code, even if I’m not problem solving.</td>

              <td class="tableContents">Reading Error Messages</td>
              <td class="tableContents">Not so confident with this one. I can read an error message okay, especially when I’m told which line a problem is on or what my code is returning. However I’m still struggling whenever my error message comes back ‘undefined’.</td>

              <td class="tableContents">Googling</td>

              <td class="tableContents">Asking peers for help</td>
              <td class="tableContents">Getting more confident with this one. I’ve asked for help in the discord a few times now and that’s worked out for me pretty much every time. I always make sure to include screen shots and try to explain what I’m trying to do and the results I’m getting.</td>

            <tr>
              <td class="tableContents">Asking coaches for help</td>
              <td class="tableContents">Same as asking my peers. I don’t tend to specify in the discord who I want help from so I’ve gotten help from peers and coaches. I have yet to ask for help in one of the 2pm sessions, so if I get stuck on a problem around the time one of those is running that’s something I’d like to try.</td>

              <td class="tableContents">Improving your process with reflection</td>
              <td class="tableContents">I think I can improve my reflection a bit more. Right now I reflect at the end of each day and when the sprint specifically calls for it. I think reflecting, through meditation or journalling, each time I complete a task will be really helpful.</td>

          <h3 class="contentHeader">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so</h3>
          <p>Again when I didn’t assign map a variable in the capitalisation challenge. I worked on that one for quite a while before asking for help. I had read through my code several times and checked it against solutions I had found on google. I was sure my code was at least mostly right and that the error would be in a misplaced bracket or syntax error. I didn’t want to ask for help with a problem that seemed so small, especially when I felt like I could solve it any moment. However a lot of moments went by without me solving it and eventually I realised I had spent way too long on this simple bit of code. I’m glad I asked for help when I did, rather than waste more time on it.</p>
