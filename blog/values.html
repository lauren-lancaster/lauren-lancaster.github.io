        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
            <ol>

                    <p>Recently, I decided to attend the Wellington Posie Parker protest. For those who don’t know, Posie Parker- AKA Kellie-Jay Keen Minshull- is an anti-transgender rights and anti-abortionist campaigner. She came to New Zealand on her ‘Let Women Speak’ tour, intending to speak in several major cities. In response to this, rallies were organised in Auckland and Wellington. She left the country before making it to Wellington but the rally went ahead, and I chose to attend it. </p>
                    <p>I deeply value freedom of speech, as well as freedom of expression, the right to live safely and without discrimination, and the right to bodily autonomy. It’s important to me that the LGBTQIA+ community are heard and that our voices are supported by our allies. It’s true that Posie Parker has the right to freedom of speech, however she should not abuse this right in order to take away from the rights and safety of women, trans and gender diverse people. I would also argue that Parker was engaging in hate-speech, and was actively attacking the transgender and non-binary community. </p>
                    <p>I stand by my decision to attend the protest. For me, with Posie Parker being absent, the atmosphere turned from a protest to a show of solidarity against intolerance. Regardless of the outcome of the protest, I would always choose to go, for both the trans community, and myself and my values.</p>
                <li class="listText">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li>
                    <p>My family, in particular my grandmothers on both sides influenced my appreciation of beauty and the arts. My grandmother on my dads side was incredibly artistic, in fact I believe she was accepted into an art school in France before leaving the opportunity behind to immigrate to New Zealand with my granddad. My bedroom was always full of toys she’d crocheted, and embroidery and cross stitching was hung up on the walls. My grandmother on my mothers side was deeply passionate about classical music, and she passed that on to my mother, who had me in piano lessons at the age of three. There was never an expectation for me to be a prodigy, just a hope that I would learn to love music as much as they did. Growing up I learned a lot about art other than western art as well. Living in Aotearoa, my first encounter of this was probably Waiata and Kapa Haka. My best friend and her mother also introduced me to songs from Madagascar. I took dance classes for jazz and hip hop as well. Even when I went back to my roots and started a degree in classical music, I always had the most fun in my minor, sonic arts, which leaned more on the experimental and electronic side of sound production. </p>
                    <p>My immediate family influenced my sense of justice and equality. Family dinners were often centred around politics and moral issues. My sister and I were always encouraged to form our own opinions, and to stand up for them. My sister, being older, was the one who introduced me to many of the beliefs I have today, especially around the LGBTQIA+ community. I think growing up in Wellington, the general environment also influenced this a lot. Many of my friends, teachers, and role models held a similar value of equality to me, and it was often openly discussed how this value affected our own beliefs.</p>
                <li class="listText">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li>
                    <p>My strengths are seeing beauty/open-mindedness, agreeability, honesty, and persistence. I think my creative mind will be helpful when learning code, allowing me to problem solve and see further options for improvement. My honesty and agreeability will be important in helping me to connect with my peers, and hopefully foster an environment where we can help each other grow. My persistence will see me through to the end of the course, not letting me stop when things get hard or I lose motivation.</p>
                <li class="listText">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
                    <p>First of all I don’t have a tech based degree. In fact, my music degree doesn’t give me many hireable skills at all, like a degree in literacy or numeracy would give me. Another limitation is my introversion- as much as I love meeting people, I struggle to talk about myself, or put myself out there. In relation to my introversion, I also have low-assertiveness, which will make group projects challenging, especially if conflict arises, however I believe assertiveness is a skill I can practice and improve.</p>
                <li class="listText">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li>
                    <p>Immediately I think of my brass quintet when two members (call them person A and person B) were fighting. Person A especially was resistant to work and would often miss rehearsals. In this situation it was really a case of picking your battles. Each musician is uniquely qualified for the role they play in the quintet, and can only play one part at a time, so there was no way to pick up Person A’s slack or cover for him when he wasn’t there. The best thing I could think to do was keep our tutor informed of the situation and focus on my own playing, being sure to rehearse alone and do everything I could to be a valuable member of the group. Person B would often get extremely frustrated with Person A and would express this frustration during rehearsals.</p>
                    <p>Our (the rest of the group and I) strategy for the tension was to simply try keep focused on the music, and not on personal grievances. Person A and Person B bickering was gently met with a suggestion on what part of the music needed rehearsing, or a new idea we’d like to try. This didn’t stop the fighting, but it did keep us on track enough to see us through to our assessment.  At the time, being a younger and less experienced member of the group, I didn’t feel I could take as much of a leadership position as I probably could have. If I were to be in that situation again, I think I’d try to take more of a social lead. Getting in touch with Person A to discuss why he wasn’t committed to the group would’ve been a good start, and then openly discussing with Person A and Person B about how their tension affected the productivity of the group would’ve been a good next step. I’m still not sure that it would’ve been my place to interfere with their conflict and relationship, with them being (I want to say friends?), but if I could make them aware of how they were affecting the rest of the group, who were relying on them for a good grade, perhaps they would’ve become more self aware.</p>
